# 🎲 Dice Game 🎲

Welcome to my **Dice Game** repository! 🚀  
This project is part of my **100 Days of Code Challenge** and showcases my progress in building fun and interactive games using JavaScript.

---

## 🌟 What I Learned Today 🌟
- **Random Number Generation**: Simulating dice rolls using `Math.random()`.
- **DOM Manipulation**: Dynamically updating the dice image and player scores.
- **Event Handling**: Adding interactivity with buttons and handling user input.
- **Game Logic**: Implementing rules to reset the score and switch players.

## 🎮 How to Play
1. Click the **Roll Dice** button to roll the dice.
2. Add the rolled number to your score unless you roll a `1`, which resets your turn!
3. Compete with friends to achieve the highest score!
